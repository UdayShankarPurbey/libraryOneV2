      The Gandhi Institute for Education and Technology (GIET) Library is committed to upholding copyright laws and promoting fair use of resources. These guidelines are provided to help our users understand and comply with copyright regulations.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Understanding Copyright</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Copyright is a form of protection given to the creators of original works, including literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works. It gives the creator exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, and license the work, and to authorize others to do so.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Fair Use</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Fair use is a legal doctrine that allows limited use of copyrighted material without requiring permission from the rights holders. Examples of fair use include commentary, criticism, news reporting, research, teaching, and scholarship. The four factors to consider when determining fair use are:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
      <li>The purpose and character of the use, including whether it is for commercial or educational purposes.</li>
      <li>The nature of the copyrighted work.</li>
      <li>The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.</li>
      <li>The effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Permitted Uses</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      a. Making a single copy of an article, book chapter, or other short work for personal study, research, or teaching.<br>
      b. Using brief excerpts of copyrighted material for educational purposes, such as in a classroom presentation or student project.<br>
      c. Displaying or performing a work in a face-to-face teaching setting at a nonprofit educational institution.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Prohibited Uses</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      a. Reproducing entire books or substantial portions of books without permission.<br>
      b. Distributing copies of copyrighted material to others for commercial purposes.<br>
      c. Posting copyrighted material on a public website without permission from the copyright owner.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Obtaining Permissions</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      If you need to use copyrighted material in a way that is not covered by fair use, you must obtain permission from the copyright owner. This may involve contacting the publisher, author, or other rights holder to request a license or other form of authorization.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6. Library Resources</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The GIET Library provides access to a wide range of resources, including databases, journals, and e-books, which may have specific usage restrictions. Please refer to the terms of use for each resource and comply with any licensing agreements.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7. Reporting Infringement</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      If you believe that your copyrighted work has been used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please contact the library staff to report the issue. We will investigate and take appropriate action as necessary.
